                <h2>What is Java?</h2>
                <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation.</p>

                <h2>Types of Editions of Java</h2>
                <p>Java has several editions tailored to different environments:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Java SE (Standard Edition):</strong> The core Java platform for general-purpose use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Java EE (Enterprise Edition):</strong> Designed for building large-scale, multi-tiered, scalable, reliable, and secure network applications.</li>
                    <li><strong>Java ME (Micro Edition):</strong> A subset of Java SE, tailored for mobile devices and embedded systems.</li>
                </ul>

            <section class="section">
                <h2>History of Java</h2>
                <p>Java was developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.</p>

                <h2>Features of Java</h2>
                <p>Java is known for its significant features:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Simple:</strong> Java's syntax is easy to learn and use.</li>
                    <li><strong>Object-Oriented:</strong> Java supports the principles of object-oriented programming, making it modular, flexible, and extensible.</li>
                    <li><strong>Portable:</strong> Java code is platform-independent, thanks to the Java Virtual Machine (JVM).</li>
                    <li><strong>Secure:</strong> Java has robust security features that enable the development of virus-free, tamper-free systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Multithreaded:</strong> Java supports multithreading, allowing multiple threads to run concurrently.</li>
                    <li><strong>Architecture-Neutral:</strong> Java's compiled code is executable on many processors with the presence of the Java runtime system.</li>
                    <li><strong>Interpreted:</strong> Java bytecode is translated on the fly to native machine instructions and not stored anywhere.</li>
                    <li><strong>High Performance:</strong> With the use of Just-In-Time compilers, Java enables high performance.</li>
                    <li><strong>Distributed:</strong> Java has a comprehensive set of APIs that make it easy to develop applications that can be distributed across various systems.</li>
                    <li><strong>Dynamic:</strong> Java is designed to adapt to an evolving environment, supporting dynamic memory allocation.</li>
                </ul>
